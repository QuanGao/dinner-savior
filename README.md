# Dinner-Savior

## A firebase powered web application that helps users report/access wait time at a restaurant in real time. Furthermore, if you decide it is not worth the wait, we would like to inspire you to cook at home with three hand picked recipes according to the types of restaurants you searched for.

### Search any restaurants => Select the correct one => Check out wait time

### You might think, oh, it is like Waze but for restaurants! You are exactly right! We rely on our users to obtain the most up-to-date data and share it with the rest of the community to help you make informed decisions.
